It is a fact, that this paper plays a decisive role in proper selection of the candidates. With vast experience in the field of report writing, drafting policy paper for the government, I find myself in a position of giving some important tips for this paper. Students must keep it in mind that with change in the pattern of the examination, specially after 2014, guess work made by some guides are not going to help them at all. The expert committee of UPSC had made a deliberate attempt to guard against the business of guess work. Like, in 2015, students were asked to prepare themselves on topics like “Make in India”, “Sanitation drive”, “Intolerance” etc, but it had not helped the students much. Moreover, UPSC had made an intelligent move to divide the paper into two section just to minimize the chance of prediction of topics made by coaching institutes. Then question arises, “What is proper strategy”? The best strategy, what I found effective is the practice of “Précis Writing”. It worked like magic band helping the students in a minimum time- from the phobia of writing meaningful essay in the Examination. I found this a time tested strategy, which worked on innumerable students. Quite a few of my students, who were from engineering background were skeptical in the beginning, but in a fortnight they found it much efficacious. I asked them often to read an article from “Yojana” or some column in the reputed daily like, ‘The Hindu’ or ‘The Indian Express’ and then to make a précis of the same. Surprisingly, what I observed that just after a fortnight, the students developed a flair of writing deftly on diverse topics. For contemporary issue, ‘Yojana’ and newspaper reading (along with Précis writing) will develop the flair of writing. In this context, I do also advise that students must file the main article on which they had written précis."/>
